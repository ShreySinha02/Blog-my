///////////////////////////////////////////Answer/////////////////////////////////////////////
Django is a high-level Python web framework that allows developers to quickly and easily build complex,
database-driven websites and applications. It provides a lot of the tools and functionality that developers
need to create robust, scalable web applications, including an ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) system for 
working with databases, a templating system for building user interfaces, and a powerful URL routing system
for handling incoming requests.


An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) is a programming technique that allows developers to work with databases using
object-oriented programming constructs, rather than having to interact with the database directly using SQL.
Django's ORM is a key part of the framework, and is used by developers to interact with the database and manage
application data. The ORM in Django is built around the concept of models, which are Python classes that represent
database tables.
